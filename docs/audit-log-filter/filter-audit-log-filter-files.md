# Filter the Audit Log Filter logs

You can filter an audit event by the following elements:

* User account
* Audit event class
* Audit event subclass
* Audit event fields (for example, `COMMAND_CLASS` or `STATUS`)

The filter definition creates auditing rules. Filter rules can log certain events and block the execution of events. You can assign a filter to multiple accounts. 

## Audit Log Filter functions

The Audit Log filter functions require `AUDIT_ADMIN` or `SUPER` privilege.
